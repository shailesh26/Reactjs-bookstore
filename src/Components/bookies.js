          "description": "Simon Sinek's recent video on 'The Millennial Question' went viral with over 150 million views. Start with Why is a global bestseller and the TED Talk based on it is the third most watched of all time. Why are some people and organisations more inventive, pioneering and successful than others? And why are they able to repeat their success again and again? In business, it doesn't matter what you do, it matters WHY you do it. Start with Why analyses leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and Steve Jobs and discovers that they all think in the same way - they all started with why. Simon Sinek explains the framework needed for businesses to move past knowing what they do to how they do it, and then to ask the more important question-WHY? Why do we do what we do? Why do we exist? Learning to ask these questions can unlock the secret to inspirational business. Sinek explains what it truly takes to lead and inspire and how anyone can learn how to do it.",

You'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification. About the Book A machine is said to learn when its performance improves with experience. Learning requires algorithms and programs that capture data and ferret out the interestingor useful patterns. Once the specialized domain of analysts and mathematicians, machine learning is becoming a skill needed by many. Machine Learning in Action is a clearly written tutorial for developers. It avoids academic language and takes you straight to the techniques you'll use in your day-to-day work. Many (Python) examples present the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization in code you can reuse. You'll understand the concepts and how they fit in with tactical tasks like classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification. Readers need no prior experience with machine learning or statistical processing. Familiarity with Python is helpful.

To begin with, the author explores language from a cultural and personal perspective. In these days of management jargon and internet technology are we losing touch with the ability to communicate fully?' Is the deeper imaginative world being left unexpressed? The main body of the book contains detailed, practical exercises for actors and directors during the rehearsal process. All exercises will be tied to specific scenes, leading to a fuller exploration of the rext. Text In Action analyses the imagery of plays, speech structures, the physicality of language and emphasises the importance of finding a collective voice. Cicely's guidance on the matter of voice will help actors find relationships and situations through the text in a unique way, in order to make it more dynamic and creative.",

But life soon took her further afield from the crowded classrooms of Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Chandigarh, where she learned about detractors, and the vast lecture halls of Panjab University, Chandigarh where she pursued her bachelors to the hallowed halls of Harvard University, Cambridge, where she learned what it felt to be the only South Asian Hindu Punjabi woman. More recently she served as an advocacy intern for Consul General, Mia Yen at the Canadian High Commission in Chandigarh. Mentor in Action takes us through Chandigarh living rooms and high-profile diplomatic boardrooms, through moments of heart-wrenching grief and profound resilience, taking us deep into the soul of an ordinary mentee from Chandigarh and her extraordinary mentor from Canada. In narrating her story with grace, good humor and rare candor, Simran moots a question to the rest of us: Who are we in action?",

          "description": "Hans Joas is one of the foremost social theorists in Germany today. Based on Joas‚Äôs celebrated study of George Herbert Mead, this work reevaluates the contribution of American pragmatism and European philosophical anthropology to theories of action in the social sciences. Joas also establishes direct ties between Mead‚Äôs work and approaches drawn from German traditions of philosophical anthropology. Joas argues for adding a third model of action to the two predominant models of rational and normative action‚Äîone that emphasizes the creative character of human action. This model encompasses the other two, allowing for a more comprehensive theory of action. Joas elaborates some implications of his model for theories of social movements and social change and for the status of action theory in sociology in the face of competition from theories advanced by Luhmann and Habermas. The problem of action is of crucial importance in both sociology and philosophy, and this book‚Äîalready widely debated in Germany‚Äîwill add fresh impetus to the lively discussions current in the English-speaking world.",

          "description": "How to use data as a tool for empowerment rather than oppression. Big data can be used for good, from tracking disease to exposing human rights violations, and for bad, implementing surveillance and control. Data inevitably represents the ideologies of those who control its use; data analytics and algorithms too often exclude women, the poor, and ethnic groups. In Data Action, Sarah Williams provides a guide for working with data in more ethical and responsible ways. Too often data has been used--and manipulated--to make policy decisions without much stakeholder input. Williams outlines a method that emphasizes collaboration among data scientists, policy experts, data designers, and the public. This approach creates trust and co-ownership in the data by opening the process to those who know the issues best.",

          "description": "Praxiology is the study of working and doing from the point of view of effectiveness. It has three components: analysis of concepts involving purposive actions; critique of modes of action from the viewpoint of efficiency; and normative advisory aspects in recommen-dations for increasing human efficacy. This sixth volume of the Praxiology series fo-cuses on action learning. Learning from distinguishable action is surprisingly different than learning from a sub-ject expert in human or book form. For those who have worked with and in action learn-ing, the latest form is always distinguishably different from a former experience. Action learning programs are not, in general, intended to tackle puzzles, namely, questions to which an answer may be said to exist even if that answer is difficult to find; action learn-ing is intended to help to develop the ability to tackle problems or opportunities, of which different persons, all experienced, intelligent, and motivated, might well advocate differ-ent courses of action, all reasonable. The essentials of action learning, according to this volume, are: there can be no learning unless the participant receives feedback about his/her performance; partici-pants learn only of their own volition and never at the will of others; the volition to learn is most readily engendered by the lure of success or by the fear of calamity. Building upon these essentials, the authors view action learning as a process of inquiry begin-ning with the experience of not knowing what to do next, and finding that an answer is not available from current expertise. All chapters in this volume are sound contributions to the continuing debate on the processes of learning from distinguishable action. Action Learning is intriguing reading for sociologists, philosophers, managers, and research-ers of all disciplines.",

This volume will be of interest not only to those who are primarily concerned with philosophy but also to students in those many other disciplines in which freedom and determinism arise as problems.",

          "description": "Since the first edition of this established text was published in 1988, action research has gained ground as a popular method amongst educational researchers, and in particular for practising teachers doing higher-level courses. In this new edition Jean McNiff provides updates on methodological discussions and includes new sections of case study material and information on supporting action research. The book raises issues about how action research is theorised, whether it is seen as a spectator discipline or as a real life practice, and how practitioners position themselves within the debate. It discusses the importance for educators of understanding their own work and showing how their educative influence can lead to the development of good orders in formal and informal learning settings and in the wider community. This second edition comes at a time when, after years of debate over what counts as action research, it is now considered an acceptable and useful part of mainstream research practice.",

Communicable and noncommunicable disease, disability and death result from a lack of safe water and sanitation, indoor and outdoor air pollution, hazardous chemicals, occupational hazards and climate-related disasters. The Western Pacific Regional Framework for Action on Health and Environment on a Changing Planetintends to relaunch the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Health and the Environment program and fulfill its mandate in the area of environmental health. It proposes to leverage the health sector focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) process, providing guidance for prioritizing the work of WHO in support of Member States improving health outcomes through action on environmental determinants. It articulates entry points for health and environment priority actions in WHO country cooperation strategies, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other mechanisms for international collaboration, and notably with the United Nations Environment Program and ministries of environment. The framework also sets a course for the health sector to advocate adaptive measures, policies and action to protect health and well-being as a co-benefit of interventions in energy, agriculture, transport, housing and other spheres.",

MongoDB is well-suited as a back-end for modern web applications. Its schema-free design encourages rapid application development, and built-in replication and auto-sharding architecture allow for massive parallel distribution. Production deployments at SourceForge, Foursquare, and Shutterfly demonstrate daily that MongoDB is up to real-world challenges. MongoDB in Action, Second Edition is a comprehensive guide to MongoDB version 2.6. It begins with a general overview of current database systems, explaining what makes MongoDB unique and describing its ideal use cases. Then, a series of tutorials lead into detailed examples for leveraging MongoDB in e-commerce, social networking, and other common applications. A reference section on schema design patterns helps ease the transition from the relational data model of SQL to MongoDB's document-based data model. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.",

          "description": "Alcohol has been central to social, religious and personal use throughout the history. Alcohol drinking goes back almost as far as the human race does. A hundred years, therefore, may be seen as only a flash. The past century, however, has witnessed a fundamental change in dealing with alcohol problems. Hence, to give an overview of a hundred years of alcohol polices is a rather ambitious task and the contributions to this book shed only some light on the way in which alcohol policy issues have changed in this period. This authoritative volume is relevant to both scientists and policy makers providing a state of the art in alcohol policy from different perspectives, covering both science/research/treatment and prevention practice and linking these areas.",

This two volume set single-handedly carves out a new and unique scholarly niche by providing the first comprehensive and secular manual to holistically address society‚Äôs universal need for personal leadership and character education. Its single-minded aim is the global promotion and proliferation of leadership, character, and life skills education in nations, communities, organizations, schools, homes, and individual lives everywhere. The concept of Self-Action Leadership (SAL) is rooted in 30 years of extensive research spanning the fields of self-leadership, leadership, action research, character education, and autoethnography. In addition to drawing on the scholarship of these extant fields, SAL simultaneously builds upon them by introducing an original theory and model that executives, administrators, scholars, teachers, and practitioners alike can universally utilize to their own advantages and to the benefit of their colleagues, subordinates, and students. Volume I‚ÄîThe Self-Action Leadership Theory‚Äîcontains prefacing material for the combined texts. It also includes the first four book sections of the two volume set.",

          "description": "Modern-day projects require software and systems engineers to work together in realizing architectures of large and complex software-intensive systems. To date, the two have used their own tools and methods to deal with similar issues when it comes to the requirements, design, testing, maintenance, and evolution of these architectures. Software and Systems Architecture in Action explores practices that can be helpful in the development of architectures of large-scale systems in which software is a major component. Examining the synergies that exist between the disciplines of software and systems engineering, it presents concepts, techniques, and methods for creating and documenting architectures. The book describes an approach to architecture design that is driven from systemic quality attributes determined from both the business and technical goals of the system, rather than just its functional requirements. This architecture-centric design approach utilizes analytically derived patterns and tactics for quality attributes that inform the architect‚Äôs design choices and help shape the architecture of a given system. The book includes coverage of techniques used to assess the impact of architecture-centric design on the structural complexity of a system. After reading the book, you will understand how to create architectures of systems and assess their ability to meet the business goals of your organization. Ideal for anyone involved with large and complex software-intensive systems, the book details powerful methods for engaging the software and systems engineers on your team. The book is also suitable for use in undergraduate and graduate-level courses on software and systems architecture as it exposes students to the concepts and techniques used to create and manage architectures of software-intensive systems.",

          "description": "This study provides a historical analysis of Freudenthal‚Äôs didactic ideas and his didactic career. It is partly biographical, but also contributes to the historiography of mathematics education and addresses closely related questions such as: what is mathematics and where does it start? Which role does mathematics play in society and what influence does it have on the prevailing views concerning its accompanying didactics?. Hans Freudenthal (1905‚Äì1990), professor in mathematics, scientist, literator, but above all mathematics-educator, was inextricably linked to the changes which took place in mathematics education and didactics during the second half of the last century. His diversity as a scientist and his inexhaustible efforts to establish the didactics of mathematics as a seriously pursued science, made Freudenthal's influence in this area considerable. He foresaw an essential, practical role for mathematics in everyone‚Äôs life, encouraging students to discover and create mathematics themselves, instead of imposing a ready-made mathematical system. The theory of mathematics education thus developed in the Netherlands would gain world fame in the following decades. Today, in the light of the discussions about mathematics education, in which the call for `genuine‚Äô mathematics instead of the so-called 'kindergarten'-mathematics can be heard, Freudenthal's approach seems to be pass√©. However, the outcome of this study (which is mainly based on documents from Freudenthal‚Äôs vast personal archive) shows a more refined picture. The direct identification of 'kindergarten'-mathematics with Freudenthal‚Äôs view on mathematics education is not justified. 'Realistic mathematics' as advocated by Freudenthal includes more than just a practical introductory and should, among other things, always aim at teaching 'genuine' mathematics in the end.",

          "description": "This dissertation is a description of Darma, an under-documented Tibeto-Burman language spoken in the eastern corner of the state of Uttarakhand, India. With fewer than 2,600 speakers and no writing system, Darma is considered endangered. This is the most comprehensive description of Darma to date. Like the other Himalayan languages, the genetic classification of Darma has not been definitively determined. It is widely described as a western Himalayish language that is closely related to Byansi, Chaudangsi and Rangkas (the latter being extinct). The data presented in this dissertation were obtained through three methodologies: direct elicitation, participant observation, and the discourse-centered approach to data collection advocated by University of Texas linguistic anthropologist Joel Sherzer. The discourse-centered methodology relies on naturally occurring speech, including conversation, stories, songs and public dialogues. The resulting data are contextualized in a cultural framework, which is useful to linguists and anthropologists alike; and the majority of examples presented come from these texts. The dissertation is presented in five sections with a total of nineteen chapters and a glossary. The first section provides background information on the Darma people, the language, and how this project came about. The second section describes the sound system of Darma, including its typologically unusual class of oral stops. The third section introduces the words that comprise a noun phrase including nouns, personal pronouns, and pronominal demonstrative forms, which are marked on a spatial axis (e.g. proximate, neutral, distal, and non-visible). The fourth section examines the affixes that combine with verb stems to form clauses and sentences. This includes a discussion of the basic SV/AOV constituent order, and the ergative/absolutive alignment system. Here nominalization/relativization, a common feature of Tibeto-Burman languages, is also presented along with the clause chaining strategy commonly found in narrative discourse. The analysis for this dissertation is informed by a functional-typological perspective, and an effort has been made to capture general patterns found in the grammar. The goals are to provide a description of the grammar of Darma in a format that is accessible to many, and to avoid relying on any overly specific theoretical framework that may become obsolete.",

          "description": "The year was 1995 and three very successful private ambulance companies joined forces in a mammoth merger to thwart the impending threat of FMR (Frequent Medical Response), the U.S.A.s largest nationally based private ambulance company. Power Ambulance from Chicago, Reagan-Stiller Ambulance from Greater Chicagoland, and Baileys Ambulance from southern Illinois and Indiana combined forces to become Tri*Medic Transport Incorporated. Code 3: The Rise & Fall of a Private Ambulance Empire proves that people from all walks of life are attracted to the strange realm that is Emergency Medical Services (E.M.S.). But like average employees, many of them come and go. Like druggies, they get their quick fix and then they leave. E.M.S. sees them come and go like the motions of the ocean. But what they leave behind are their unforgettable stories. Code 3: The Rise & Fall of a Private Ambulance Empire is not your typical novel about the heroisms of what takes place in the back of an ambulance, rather, Code 3 takes you on a fast-paced lights and sirens ride through the delightful disgraces that are hidden well from the public eye. The tribulations of the mighty E.M.S. Tri*Medic are well chronicled in this in-depth partisan culture of the unique private ambulance company world. Code 3: The Rise & Fall of a Private Ambulance Empire is a dauntless expos of Nazi Germany and the Titanic Disaster, uniquely intertwined in the unforgiving E.M.S. field of battle. Code 3 is set inside a huge garage on the north side of Chicago that is a branch of the massive private ambulance company merger. It was inside this garage that most of the mayhem took place, making for an unforgettable reading experience. Like the stories and characters involved in the inception of this novel, you will never forget it.",

          "description": "An eerie, alienating, yet comic and profoundly sympathetic short story collection about Americans in America by one of Indonesia‚Äôs most prominent writers, now in an English translation for its fortieth anniversary, with a foreword by Intan Paramaditha A Penguin Classic In these seven stories of The People from Bloomington, our peculiar narrators find themselves in the most peculiar of circumstances and encounter the most peculiar of people. Set in Bloomington, Indiana, where the author lived as a graduate student in the 1970s, this is far from the idyllic portrait of small-town America. Rather, sectioned into apartment units and rented rooms, and gridded by long empty streets and distances traversable only by car, it‚Äôs a place where the solitary can all too easily remain solitary; where people can at once be obsessively curious about others, yet fail to form genuine connections with anyone. The characters feel their loneliness acutely and yet deliberately estrange others. Budi Darma paints a realist world portrayed through an absurdist frame, morbid and funny at the same time. For decades, Budi Darma has influenced and inspired many writers, artists, filmmakers, and readers in Indonesia, yet his stories transcend time and place. With The People from Bloomington, Budi Darma draws us to a universality recognized by readers around the world‚Äîthe cruelty of life and the difficulties that people face in relating to one another while negotiating their own identities. The stories are not about ‚Äústrangeness‚Äù in the sense of culture, race, and nationality. Instead, they are a statement about how everyone, regardless of nationality or race, is strange, and subject to the same tortures, suspicions, yearnings, and peculiarities of the mind.",

Laird brings these meetings to life in this vibrant, monumental work that outlines the essence of thousands of years of civilization, myth, and spirituality. Tibet‚Äôs story is rich with tradition and filled with promise. It begins with the Bodhisattva Chenrizi (‚ÄúThe Holy One‚Äù) whose spirit many Tibetans believe resides within the Dalai Lama. We learn the origins of Buddhism, and about the era of Great Tibetan Emperors, whose reign stretched from southwestern China to Northern India. His Holiness introduces us to Tibet‚Äôs greatest yogis and meditation masters, and explains how the institution of the Dalai Lama was founded. Laird explores, with His Holiness, Tibet‚Äôs relations with the Mongols, the Golden Age under the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, Tibet‚Äôs years under Manchu overlords, modern independence in the early twentieth century, and the Dalai Lama‚Äôs personal meetings with Mao just before His Holiness fled into exile in 1959. The Story of Tibet is ‚Äúa tenderly crafted study that is equal parts love letter, traditional history and oral history‚Äù (Publishers Weekly). ‚ÄúCaptivating reading.‚Äù ‚ÄîTricycle",

          "description": "In May 1998, President Suharto stepped down as President of Indonesia. With his fall, the third largest country in Asia has plunged into anarchy and political, economic and social strife. Racial and religious clashes, culminating in riots, burning and chaos, have become the order of the day. Fissures in the social fabric are widening and there is a real danger that this multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural country may disintegrate, just like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Indonesia today is a fragile nation, a country in crisis. It is breaking apart because just as Sukarno had failed in his interplay of strength between Communism and the armed forces, Suharto failed to keep the balance of power between the armed forces and Islam. Moreover, the Indonesian people, by and large, have lost the spirit of tolerance, symbolised in the Indonesian state crest, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). Without this spirit, so vital to a multi-religious and plural society, Indonesia is becoming economically ravaged, spiritually plundered, politically distraught, and socially incoherent. The author served as Singapore's Ambassador to Indonesia from 1970 to 1974. His interest in Indonesia began many years ago from 1955, when he had gone to Bandung to cover the Afro-Asian conference as a journalist. As Ambassador, he had the opportunity to travel widely across the country and observe the Indonesians at close quarters. Today, his friends range from President Suharto, Indonesia's military leaders, governors, mayors, to ordinary citizens, journalists, musicians and artists. In this book, he portrays the Indonesian people, their history and their cultural traditions. He provides insightful analyses and perspectives of the political collapse of Suharto and describes the danger facing the country. Describing the diversity in the history, traditions, customs and cultures of the various ethnic groups, he understands Indonesia like no other. Bringing the outsider's clarity of perception and the journalist-diplomat's experience of tradition and history, Lee Khoon Choy speaks with authority and credibility, passion and sensitivity about the challenges facing a vast, heterogeneous country that comprises 336 ethnic groups speaking 250 dialects.

Taking as its starting point Tibet's so-called age of fragmentation (842 to 986 C.E.), the book draws on previously unstudied manuscripts discovered in the \"library cave\" near Dunhuang, on the old Silk Road. These ancient documents, it argues, demonstrate how this purportedly inactive period in Tibetan history was in fact crucial to the Tibetan assimilation of Buddhism, and particularly to the spread of violent themes from tantric Buddhism into Tibet at the local and the popular levels. Having shed light on this \"dark age\" of Tibetan history, the second half of the book turns to how, from the late tenth century onward, the period came to play a vital symbolic role in Tibet, as a violent historical \"other\" against which the Tibetan Buddhist tradition defined itself. -- Georges Dreyfus",

With Gods grace, the CIA acted as liaison with SOCOM (Special Operations Command) in a highly classified, Super Secret, clandestine operation, code-named Wrath of God. The land of milk and honey is under siege by genocidal Islamic combatants. The threat to humanity must be terminated under the most supreme lawthe divine decree of Gods law. Judahs Justice sheds a very bright light upon a very dark path that our courageous counterterrorism operatives must tread. Youll be deeply shaken, inspired, and motivated to respect and honor the sacred men and women of the CIA Directorate of Operations, Clandestine Service. Without their sacrifices in the face of existing dangers, America would be under martial law; our civil liberties and freedoms lost. Life in America would be anarchy. The true colors of our star-spangled banner would no longer shine. Judahs Justice is the stage for the NWOD (New World Order Decree) endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.",

          "description": "\"This thesis is a study of traditional narratives which are recited and received both by villagers and pilgrims in regard to the local pilgrimage (ziarah) tradition in Pamijahan, particularly at Shaykh Abdul Muhyi's sacred site. The narratives will be examined as part of the popular beliefs of Priangan Timur or the eastern part of West Java. Locating them in the wider context of Sundanese oral and written traditions, my investigation will illuminate the nature and function of such traditions in the particular case of Pamijahan. The research will elucidate the role of the kuncen, the custodians of sacred sites, as guides and spiritual brokers who maintain the narratives. It will also be important to investigate the villagers' as well as visitors' view of the kuncen in regard to local pilgrimage. The study will also enhance comparative studies concerned with networks of holy men or saints (wali) on the island of Java (Pemberton 1994; Fox 1991: 20). I want to argue that people respond to, and participate in, saint veneration on pragmatic grounds. However, these grounds are subject to interpretation and contestation in time and space. In redefining their narratives, various individuals, such as custodians, Sufis, and even to some extent government functionaries, are considered to be authoritative persons by virtue of their capacity to conduct and manipulate narratives. As this argument develops, it will be important to understand the modes of signification in the village.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Perpetually cheerful and eager to please, Gracie Cooper strives to make the best out of every situation. So when her father dies just months after a lung cancer diagnosis, she sets aside her dreams of pursuing her passion for art to take over his Midtown Manhattan champagne shop. She soon finds out that the store‚Äôs profit margins are being squeezed perilously tight, and complicating matters further, a giant corporation headed by the impossibly handsome, but irritatingly arrogant Sebastian Andrews is proposing a buyout. But Gracie can‚Äôt bear the thought of throwing away her father‚Äôs dream like she did her own. Overwhelmed and not wanting to admit to her friends or family that she‚Äôs having second thoughts about the shop, Gracie seeks advice and solace from someone she‚Äôs never met‚Äîthe faceless ‚ÄúSir‚Äù, with whom she connected on a blind dating app where matches get to know each other through messages and common interests before exchanging real names or photos. But although Gracie finds herself slowly falling for Sir online, she has no idea she‚Äôs already met him in real life‚Ä¶and they can‚Äôt stand each other.",

What the difference is between mature and immature love? What role sex plays in romantic love, and whether love necessarily implies sexual exclusivity? And, most important, how can we make love last? Originally published in 1980, this updated edition of The Psychology of Romantic Love explores the nature of romantic love on many levels-the philosophical, the historical, the sociological, and the physiological. Nathaniel Branden explains why so many people say that romantic love is just not possible in today's world and-drawing on his experience with thousands of couples-finds that such love is still a possibility for anyone who understands its essence and is willing to accept its challenges. Branden sees it as a pathway not only to extraordinary joy but also to profound self-discovery. His vision of love is thoroughly appropriate to our time and grounded in our humanness.",

          "description": "A New York Times bestseller and enduring classic, All About Love is the acclaimed first volume in feminist icon bell hooks' \"Love Song to the Nation\" trilogy. All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòlove‚Äô is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,‚Äù writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society‚Äôs failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question ‚ÄúWhat is love?‚Äù her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the ‚Äú100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.‚Äù All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.",

Alice had her whole summer planned. Nonstop all-you-can-eat buffets while marathoning her favorite TV shows (best friends totally included) with the smallest dash of adulting‚Äîworking at the library to pay her share of the rent. The only thing missing from her perfect plan? Her girlfriend (who ended things when Alice confessed she's asexual). Alice is done with dating‚Äîno thank you, do not pass go, stick a fork in her, done. But then Alice meets Takumi and she can‚Äôt stop thinking about him or the rom com-grade romance feels she did not ask for (uncertainty, butterflies, and swoons, oh my!). When her blissful summer takes an unexpected turn and Takumi becomes her knight with a shiny library-employee badge (close enough), Alice has to decide if she‚Äôs willing to risk their friendship for a love that might not be reciprocated‚Äîor understood. Claire Kann‚Äôs debut novel Let‚Äôs Talk About Love, chosen by readers like you for Macmillan's young adult imprint Swoon Reads, gracefully explores the struggle with emerging adulthood and the complicated line between friendship and what it might mean to be something more. Praise for Let‚Äôs Talk About Love from the Swoon Reads community: ‚ÄúA sweet and beautiful journey about self-discovery and identity!‚Äù ‚ÄîMacy Filia, reader on SwoonReads.com ‚ÄúThere aren't many novels that have asexual characters and it's something people need more of.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlice, reader on SwoonReads.com ‚ÄúI want this on my shelf where I can admire it every day.‚Äù ‚ÄîKiara, reader on SwoonReads.com",

          "description": "What is love? Aside from being the title of many a popular love song, this is one of life s perennial questions. In \"What Love Is,\" philosopher Carrie Jenkins offers a bold new theory on the nature of romantic love that reconciles its humanistic and scientific components. Love can be a social construct (the idea of a perfect fairy tale romance) and a physical manifestation (those anxiety- inducing heart palpitations); we must recognize its complexities and decide for ourselves how to love. Motivated by her own polyamorous relationships, she examines the ways in which our parameters of love have recently changedto be more accepting of homosexual, interracial, and non-monogamous relationshipsand how they will continue to evolve in the future. Full of anecdotal, cultural, and scientific reflections on love, \"What Love Is\" is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand what it means to say I love you. Whether young or old, gay or straight, male or female, polyamorous or monogamous, this book will help each of us decide for ourselves how we choose to love. \"",

Frank's parents emigrated from Korea, and have pretty much one big rule for Frank - he must only date Korean girls. But he's got strong feelings for a girl in his class, Brit - and she's not Korean. His friend Joy Song is in the same boat and knows her parents will never accept her Chinese American boyfriend, so they make a pact: they'll pretend to date each other in order to gain their freedom. Frank thinks fake-dating is the perfect plan, but it leaves him wondering if he ever really understood love - or himself - at all. David Yoon's debut novel is a quirky, authentic, heartbreaking romantic comedy and a refreshingly different take on race, immigrant communities, friendship and family.",

The book is divided into two parts: (1) Soborno‚Äôs fight with Imams to change their perception on non-Muslims and (2) his fights with Muslim Americans to denounce terrorism and be patriotic. Millions of people joined his campaign across the world‚Äîespecially people in Bangladesh where two young Muslim students, Sadiyan Lima (Dhaka University) and Marjia Farzana (Jahangirnagar University), led the movement on behalf of their respective universities. It inspired many people, including Zahid Hossain and Safir Biplob and his son, to stand against the terror of the Islamic State. Zahid published Soborno‚Äôs biography, while Safir and his son went to 64,000 villages in Bangladesh posting 64,000 posters. Meanwhile, Uday Bengali made a documentary, I Love Christmas, which created an anti-terrorism movement around Bangladesh that is based on the philosophy of Soborno.",

The first woman has become the last woman. The only true seal. What if it was all planned before this world was created? To save all humanity, mankind must find the only true key; the Omega. On the other hand, to restore the lost kingdom of darkness, the devil must find the most wanted catalyst; The Omega. When everyone‚Äôs fate is in your hands what are the risks to yourself? It is a dash against time as total obliteration of the losing team is imminent and inevitable. It is a story of courage, steadfast and honor in the face of death. When loyalty is tested to breaking points. When the person you are to protect is the same person you must kill to save humanity from extinction? Some choices are meant for gods as humans are too weak and unequipped to handle such traumatic experiences. One man‚Äôs quest to solve God‚Äôs Dilemma, but at what cost? One lady‚Äôs quest to clear her name and enjoy life like every woman out there, but with what is at stake will the evil regime turn a blind eye?And at what expense?On the edge of the seat from the word go.

But the flow of love is blocked in moments of hurt, blame, anger, criticism, competition or insecurity. These emotions have dominated our emotional space, and hardly enable us to feel our own love. So today, we rely on someone else to love us. This book teaches us to think right, enable self-love, feel it and extend it to other people. The central message here is that love is not ‚Äòout there‚Äô, but within us. A spectrum of emotions like attachment, expectations, hurt, worry, stress, fear or anger, which we use in the pretext of love, are analysed. The conversations also explore the fact that the parent-child relationship is not challenging ‚Äì It does not need to be. As you free yourself from judgments and expectations, as you start thinking right for people, and as you accept people for who they are, you become a Radiator of unconditional love. You are one decision away from vibrating at a frequency of love ‚Ä¶ by not needing love or giving love ‚Äì but just by being love.",

When you want to forget about the divisiveness and the anger? For over five million people, that place is Love What Matters, a digital platform dedicated to finding and sharing the daily moments of kindness, compassion, and love that so often go overlooked. This curated collection of powerful stories features first person accounts and photographs that perfectly capture each moment: A husband learning he‚Äôs about to be a dad. A new mom embracing her body. A cashier inadvertently teaching a young girl a lesson about patience. A bagel from a stranger that saved a homeless man‚Äôs life. From long overdue adoptions to military heroes returning home; from a fireman‚Äôs touching 9/11 tribute to what an old dinner plate found at a bake sale can teach us all about life‚Äîthese are the moments that matter. They are genuine. Authentic. Raw. And they are perfect in their imperfection‚Äîjust like all of us. You will no doubt experience goosebumps and tears, but this mosaic of life‚Äôs moments will leave you with something even more profound: a reminder that, in the end, love always wins. ‚ÄúThis really is the best page on Facebook. It renews your love of humanity. There are still good people. We need more reports of acts of kindness.‚Äù ‚ÄîJohnny",

These days he is just about surviving life in America, tapping his radiator each evening to let his upstairs neighbour know he's still alive, drawing attention to himself at the milk counter of Starbucks. But life wasn't always like this: sixty years ago in the Polish village where he was born Leo fell in love with a young girl called Alma and wrote a book in honour of his love. These days he assumes that the book, and his dreams, are irretrievably lost, until one day they return to him in the form of a brown envelope. Meanwhile, a young girl, hoping to find a cure for her mother's loneliness, stumbles across a book that changed her mother's life and she goes in search of the author. Soon these and other worlds collide in The History of Love, a captivating story of the power of love, of loneliness and of survival.",

          "description": "Based on the available information and the data hitherto collected, my hypothesis is that the further I stay away from love, the better off I will be. 'Contemporary romance's unicorn: the elusive marriage of deeply brainy and delightfully escapist.' Christina Lauren, New York Times bestselling author of The Unhoneymooners * When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos. As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive on her way to a happily ever after was always going to be tough, scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting woman, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when he agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire and Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support (and his unyielding abs), their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. Olive soon discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope. What the five star reviews are saying about The Love Hypothesis: 'Did I read this in 24 hours? Yes.' 'Funny. Snarky. Intelligent. Real.' 'If you're even slightly thinking about getting this book to read, just go a head and do it' 'Adam is just *swoon*' 'Ali Hazelwood has made herself an auto-buy author' 'It was just... perfect.' 'A heroine you will instantly fall in love with'",

But not Holly and Gerry. Childhood sweethearts, they could finish each other's sentences and even when they fought, they laughed. No one could imagine Holly and Gerry without each other. Until the unthinkable happens. Gerry's death devastates Holly. But as her 30th birthday looms, Gerry comes back to her. He's left her a bundle of notes, one for each of the months after his death, gently guiding Holly into her new life without him, each note signed 'PS, I Love You'. As the notes are gradually opened, and as the year unfolds, Holly is both cheered up and challenged. The man who knows her better than anyone sets out to teach her that life goes on. With some help from her friends, and her noisy and loving family, Holly finds herself laughing, crying, singing, dancing -- and being braver than ever before. Life is for living, she realises -- but it always helps if there's an angel watching over you.",

But while each person he meets‚Äîthe fisherman, the actor, and others‚Äîhas an answer to his question, not one seems quite right. Could love really be a fish, or applause, or the night? Or could it actually be something much closer to home? This tender, funny tale is an original take on the \"I love you\" story, a picture book treasure for all ages to read and cherish.

I loved it.' Kit de Waal Did you mean to marry me? Did you understand the vows that we took? J's wife has left, and J is trying to understand why. How could someone you loved so much, who claimed to love you once, just walk away? How could they send divorce papers accusing you of terrible things, when all you've ever done is tried to make them happy? Narrated by J in the days, weeks and months after the marriage collapses, and interspersed with the departed wife's diary entries, Is This Love? is an addictive, deeply unsettling, and provocative novel of deception and betrayal, and passion turned to pain. As the story unfolds, and each character's version of events undermines the other, all our assumptions about victimhood, agency, love and control are challenged - for we never know J's gender. If we did, would it change our minds about who was telling the truth?",

Why Should The State S Refusal To Recognize A Union As Marriage Mean That The Union Is Not A Marriage? In Love S Rite Ruth Vanita Asks This Challenging Question In Order To Emphasize That Mutual Consent And Family And Community Recognition Validate A Marriage-And This Support Frequently Extends To Same-Sex Marriages As Well. When People Claim The Right To Marry, Their Sex Or Sexuality Is Not Intrinsic To That Right, Although Social Prejudice Makes It Appear So. Moreover, It Cannot Be Denied That A Multitude Of Events And Depictions In Vastly Different Cultures, Times And Places, All Point To The Possibility Of Same-Sex Love And Commitment Being Recognized And Accepted. Marriage Is A Universal Rite Of Passage That Can, In The Right Circumstances, Become The Perfect Ceremony Of Love S Rite . Vanita Examines The Twin Phenomena Of Same-Sex Weddings And Same-Sex Joint Suicides (Mostly Female) That Have Been Reported From Many Parts Of India. She Argues That These Couples, When They Choose To Marry Or Die Together, Invoke Long-Standing But Fluid Indian Legal, Religious, And Literary-Cinematic Traditions To Declare Their Love To The World. Using Her Intimate Knowledge Of Ancient Indian Textual History, The Author Demonstrates That Same-Sex Love And Relationships Are Deeply Rooted In Indian Culture- And Compares The Cultural And Legal Implications Of Same-Sex Marriage In India With Those In The West. The International Debate On Same-Sex Marriage Is Relevant To All Democratic Societies Today. Ruth Vanita Brings A Fresh Perspective To This Debate, Suggesting That Same-Sex Marriage Dwells At The Heart, Not On The Margins, Of Culture. An Effortless Combination Of Empathy, Moral Conviction And Deep Cultural Sensitivity -Ashis Nandy",

Young Cassie Weaver only wants what is expected of an Amish woman: a good Amish husband and a large family. But she‚Äôs happy as Job and Dinah Keim‚Äôs housekeeper, helping Dinah, who is losing her sight due to diabetes. For two decades the Keims have prayed for the salvation of their two children who left the community in a cloud of shame and mystery. Mason knew there was more to his mother‚Äôs past than she let on, but nothing could have prepared him for learning about his Amish roots upon his mother‚Äôs sudden death. Even more surprising, his mother named her Amish parents, Job and Dinah, as guardians to her five children. Now Mason has to trust that this couple, and their pretty housekeeper, can take care of his younger siblings, even when all he wants is to take care of them himself. As the children adjust to this new lifestyle, Mason finds himself pulled back to the Keims‚Äô home. Yes, he wants to see his siblings, but it‚Äôs the conversations with Cassie that keep him coming back for more. Is there more to this Amish faith and how does it play into his own past? Cassie guards against her growing feelings for Mason, because there can be no happy ending for a Plain girl in love with an Englisch man . . . right? Bestselling and award-winning Amish romance novelist Kelly Irvin is back with a heartwarming tale of the power of love to heal all wounds. The first in a new, sweet Amish romance series Full novel at 98,000 words Includes discussion questions for book clubs",

          "description": "In 2009, the Delhi High Court's historic judgment overturning Section 377 as violative of the Indian Constitution referred to Same-Sex Love in India. So did the 2018 Supreme Court decision which upheld that judgment. All the petitions against this anti-sodomy law have cited this landmark book to prove that homosexuality is not a Western import. Same-Sex Love in India is the book that brought to light the long, incontestable history of same-sex love and desire in the Indian subcontinent. Covering over 2000 years, from the Mahabharata to the late twentieth century, the book contains excerpts from stories, poems, letters, biographies and histories in fifteen languages. The editors' introductions to each period and text trace the changing depictions of and debates around same-sex relations, illuminating their social, political and literary contexts. These essays have been called 'outstanding works of scholarship'. Including writings that range from romantic to analytical, playful to thoughtful, this classic work will help you see Indian culture and society with new eyes.",

          "description": "A man she couldn't forget ... a second chance to prove that love never fails. A clean wholesome romance that's touching and tender. Maddie Grantham and Jeff Young fell head over heels in love almost a year ago, but sudden deployment orders kept them from following a standard path down the aisle. They got married in front of a local judge just days before Jeff was flown away with his team. Maddie tried to keep a smile on her face but seeing the other military wives pitying her on a daily basis was wearing on her. When she had the chance to change her perspective, she jumped at it. She moved to Montana and continued her work as a pediatric nurse, working with cancer patients. That was nine months ago, and now her husband is back. They were married for less than a week before he left, and Maddie is having to come to terms with the fact that she's married to a virtual stranger. She loves him, or at least, she loves what she knew about him. Now she has to learn to love the man standing in front of her and not let her fear of the future keep her from living up to the kind of wife she promised Jeff she'd be. Jeff Young leads a team of Special Forces soldiers into some of the most horrific places on the earth. He's just returned after spending several months in captivity. He returned to base, hoping to see his wife waiting there for him, but instead he is summoned to the CO's office. His wife moved to Montana! Jeff is given the opportunity to go to her and decide if he wishes to remain in the military. To say his wife is surprised when he shows up is an understatement. She's thrilled to have him back with her, but also terrified that he will be called away again. Join Jeff and Maddie as they navigate the waters of their relationship and learn to love each other again. Love came in like a tidal wave the first time around. Hurried and without any of the normal wedding accouterments. No family. No parents. No wedding cake or reception. No wedding dress. When two of Jeff's new friends suggest changing that, he can't help but go along with it. His love for Maddie is larger than life. With the help of the townsfolk and his friends, he'll give Maddie what she's always longed for. A wedding that only Castle Peaks could pull off.",

He is a successful, good-looking, caring doctor. A good, loving man. Though sought after by women, he is a confirmed bachelor. He scoffs at his grandfather's vision about him meeting his wolf-mate but does as he is asked and keeps an open mind and heart. With the passing of her husband shortly after her mother's passing, she can finally see an end to the lifetime of mental, emotional, and physical abuse she has dealt with at their hands. Though she's a very beautiful, loving, caring, woman, the abuse left her feeling unworthy and undeserving of ever finding true love and happiness. Their lives were very intertwined without either being aware of the other. Until fate stepped in to bring them together. They knew there was something special about the other as soon as their eyes met. They knew it was more than just physical attraction at the first innocent touch. They were connected somehow. His medical knowledge can help her physically after a stalker leaves her body broken, but can his love heal the scars left from the abuse she has suffered?",

[This book] teems with real, Trinidadian life.‚Äù‚ÄîClaire Adam, award-winning author of Golden Child SEMI-FINALIST FOR THE OCM BOCAS PRIZE ‚Ä¢ One of the Best Books of the Summer: Time ‚Ä¢ The Guardian ‚Ä¢ Goop ‚Ä¢ Women‚Äôs Day ‚Ä¢ LitHub After Betty Ramdin‚Äôs husband dies, she invites a colleague, Mr. Chetan, to move in with her and her son, Solo. Over time, the three become a family, loving each other deeply and depending upon one another. Then, one fateful night, Solo overhears Betty confiding in Mr. Chetan and learns a secret that plunges him into torment. Solo flees Trinidad for New York to carve out a lonely existence as an undocumented immigrant, and Mr. Chetan remains the singular thread holding mother and son together. But soon, Mr. Chetan‚Äôs own burdensome secret is revealed, with heartbreaking consequences. Love After Love interrogates love and family in all its myriad meanings and forms, asking how we might exchange an illusory love for one that is truly fulfilling. In vibrant, addictive Trinidadian prose, Love After Love questions who and how we love, the obligations of family, and the consequences of choices made in desperation. Praise for Love After Love ‚ÄúLove After Love is gift after gift. An unforgettable symphony of love and loss, heartache and guilt, and the secrets and lies that pull us together, and tear us apart.

I was in your kitchen when you told me cheating is wrong, and will never be right. But the biggest conflict is when you fall in love with someone who isn‚Äôt yours. ‚ÄúYou said people fall in and out of love every day, and that most of it is bullshit‚Ä¶being more about passion and temporary emotions. But when the person you‚Äôre cheating with is worth a commitment and sacrifice, and when you‚Äôre prepared in your heart and mind to walk through the fire of the mess, it might be something real after all. That was and still is KaToria McNabb.‚Äù Fate via her unconceivable success reconnected the unlikely pair. What has happened? Why didn‚Äôt he call? Why didn‚Äôt she reach out? Ashton and Tori unravel the paths their lives took after Blakewood State University. It‚Äôs been a painful twelve-year journey of losses, betrayal, miscommunications, and death. Even in between the devastation were new lives, burgeoning careers, and millions being earned by them both. Nonetheless, can the wins override the pain in between? Publisher‚Äôs Note: ‚ÄúOur Reckless Hope‚Äù is book THREE of a THREE-book series. This book contains angst, profanity, and sexually explicit content. If either of these elements is not what you prefer between the pages of a novel, this is not the venture for you.",

          "description": "When an impetuous young man is imprisoned for conspiracy to deal cocaine, his mother's shame drives her to keep his whereabouts secret from her friends, colleagues, and most especially from her own distant, aristocratic mother. The cover story requires an elaborate -- sometimes almost absurd -- set of contortions. Set at the peak of the \"Just Say No\" era in the late 1980s, Visible Means of Support depicts a young felon's adjustment to life inside the federal correctional system, as well as his mother's struggle with self-blame and her efforts to reconcile herself to her son's plight. Will the trouble tear this small family apart? If the secret leaks, will the people around her delight in spreading this gossip? Will it seal off her chance of promotion at the high school where she teaches? How can either son or mother ever again earn respect? And is the grandmother better off not knowing? Visible Means of Support deals with universal issues not amenable to easy answers. Told from the points of view of the three main characters, this gripping, provocative, ultimately hopeful story explores the costs of locking away the truth, however unsavory, as well as the potential release to be found in setting it free.",

          "description": "What is love's real aim? Why is it so ruthlessly selective in its choice of loved ones? Why do we love at all? In addressing these questions, Simon May develops a radically new understanding of love as the emotion we feel towards whomever or whatever we experience as grounding our life--as offering us a possibility of home in a world that we supremely value. He sees love as motivated by a promise of \"ontological rootedness,\" rather than, as two thousand years of tradition variously asserts, by beauty or goodness, by a search for wholeness, by virtue, by sexual or reproductive desire, by compassion or altruism or empathy, or, in one of today's dominant views, by no qualities at all of the loved one. After arguing that such founding Western myths as the Odyssey and Abraham's call by God to Canaan in the Bible powerfully exemplify his new conception of love, May goes on to re-examine the relation of love to beauty, sex, and goodness in the light of this conception, offering among other things a novel theory of beauty--and suggesting, against Plato, that we can love others for their ugliness (while also seeing them as beautiful). Finally, he proposes that, in the Western world, romantic love is gradually giving way to parental love as the most valued form of love: namely, the love without which one's life is not deemed complete or truly flourishing. May explains why childhood has become sacred and excellence in parenting a paramount ideal--as well as a litmus test of society's moral health. In doing so, he argues that the child is the first genuinely \"modern\" supreme object of love: the first to fully reflect what Nietzsche called \"the death of God.\"",

There's an algorithm for everything else, so why not love? When 24-year-old lawyer Romy learns that she is at her 'optimal stopping point' (the mathematically designated point at which one should select the next 'best person' who comes along in order to have the best chance at happily ever after), she knows it's time to get serious about her love life. Ruthlessly rational, with a belief in data over destiny, Romy knows that reliability and consistency are dependable options, while passion and lust are transitory and only bring pain and disillusionment. That's why sensible Hans the engineer is the right choice, as opposed to graphic designer James who exhibits the kind of behaviour that has got her into trouble before. Isn't he? LONGLISTED FOR THE AUSTRALIAN BOOK DESIGN AWARDS 2022 BEST DESIGNED COMMERCIAL FICTION COVER Praise for Love, in Theory 'Cheesman plays with love's biggest questions, like: Is finding a life partner chaos? Or could there be an underlying logic? A hopeful, feel-good read, Love, in Theory perfectly captures the beauty - and occasional horror - of dating in the modern age.' - Jessie Stephens, author of Heartsick",

Throw in the facts that he‚Äôs sexier than homemade sin and gainfully employed, and there‚Äôs no doubt he‚Äôs a certified keeper. So, why at age twenty-nine is he childless and a virgin? Stricken by a severe case of lust, Nicholas asks himself the same questions when he meets the irresistible Royce Phillips, a nurse turned health-and-fitness mogul. Her chance emergence into his world is more catastrophic than any natural disaster. For the first time in his life, Nicholas rethinks the decision he made as a little boy to become a Catholic priest. The raw essence of Royce causes him to long for romantic love and the intimate touch of a woman‚Äîboth forbidden pleasures he‚Äôs vowed to never partake of. And Royce isn‚Äôt spiritually strong enough to lead him not into temptation. Now, fully indulged in the most sizzling secret affair of all time, Nicholas is living a double life. He‚Äôs a righteous man in the pulpit, preaching to his flock, but night after night, he‚Äôs anything but holy in Royce‚Äôs bed. The young priest is torn between his vow to God and his love for this woman who has grown tired of being his part-time lover. She wants more. She wants it all. So, Nicholas is forced to choose between the church and the love of his life. Heartbroken, Royce must learn to live without the man who made her feel born again, and a tiny, unexpected blessing gives her the inspiration to do just that. But while Royce embraces the next phase of her life, Nicholas realizes he can‚Äôt live without her. He takes a leap of faith, placing love before tradition. Happily together at last, tragedy tests the strength of their bond. Nicholas believes they‚Äôre being punished for the decision he made. He makes a new vow to God in exchange for a miracle, and this time, it‚Äôs a vow he plans to keep forever.",

She began writing songs at a very young age and as she began to understand herself more, within love and heartbreak, she evolved these journal entries into poems. ‚ÄúLove‚Äôs Lobotomy‚Äù is her debut as an author. Within this thought provoking collection of poems she expresses all the feelings she felt for men who she loved and experienced at one time or another. This book took Swaizi almost six years to complete. She reminisces her first love, describes polarizing infatuations, and also paints a vivid picture of her desperate need to fall out of love. Within her poems she often combines the senses and personifies the universe, this creates an unexpected image challenging average thought, for example giving color to emotions. Stylishly playing with the idea of being able to surgically rid herself of love this book can resonate with anyone who has experienced such a powerful sentiment.",

          "description": "Love's Labour's Lost is one of William Shakespeare's early comedies, believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the Inns of Court before Queen Elizabeth I. It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies makes them forsworn. In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire, reckoning and rationalisation, and reality versus fantasy.Though first published in quarto in 1598, the play's title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play. While there are no obvious sources for the play's plot, the four main characters are loosely based on historical figures. The use of apostrophes in the play's title varies in early editions, though it is most commonly given as Love's Labour's Lost.",

When Daisha‚Äôs boyfriend, Raekwan, takes his violent, jealous antics to the next level, a mysterious stranger intervenes, taking Daisha to his place to nurse her wounds. Even though she sneaks out the next morning. Daisha can‚Äôt stop thinking about him; but with her history of bad relationships with men and with her estranged mother, she knows that she should only be concerned with her own survival. In time, she will realize that he has a strong grip on her emotionally, and she has no control. Tyreek, AKA Pistol, witnesses Daisha‚Äôs assault and suddenly finds himself caring about a stranger. His life of crime has toughened him, but his thoughts are consumed with her safety. On the run from the feds, he knows that trust and loyalty are rarely given in the streets. After fleeing to Atlanta, he pulls off a murder that sets off a domino effect of events he never sees coming. There‚Äôs a street war brewing, but Pistol and Daisha are fighting a battle in their hearts. Despite all the drama and bloodshed surrounding them, they can‚Äôt seem to deny their true feelings. Will they make it out alive to pursue the prospect of a real hood love, or will it all be consumed by the fate of the streets?",

          "description": "Returning from exile, Katie is looking to start a new life in her old hometown. Her family abandoned her once, allowing her grandfather's feud to rule their lives. Back then, it cost her a childhood friend. Now, it could cost even more. Carlos saw the reflection of his true love through the power of the famous magic mirror. Everything seemed okay - until she learned his name. Could his destined wife be the missing McCray daughter who left town all those years before? Their families' feud had already ended one ill-fated love affair in the past, resulting in the loss of two people and a broken heart. Could a love based on a reflection survive their grandfathers' wrath, and how was he supposed to concentrate on starting his new business with all these questions hanging over his head? Betty's note: each book in the Love's Magic series is a standalone romance novel, and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read other books in the series. This is the clear print edition of Love's Enemy, with a 14pt font size for easier reading.",

          "description": "From the very beginning of time, God's purpose for man was to be His companion. Above all, it has always been God's plan to have a loving relationship with man. However, God would not compel man to love Him. God wanted man to love Him by his own choice, so God presented man with a choice. When man chose his own self-determination and own wisdom rather than accepting God benevolent love, God turned man away from the garden of Eden. Sin, suffering, and hardship became man's plight by his own choice. That would have been a sad outcome except in spite of man's self-serving selfish actions, God never stopped loving him. The Bible chronicles God's unrelenting actions to win man love. Only when we acknowledge God's relentless love by accepting the love relationship exemplified by Jesus will we experience the bond that God intended for us from the very beginning. When we accept God's love by following Jesus's example, our desire will be to meet God's expectations. Jesus taught us that this can be best accomplished by being obedient to his will and daily following the PASS Principle. The purpose of this book is to share the story of God's amazing love so that we can envision God's plan, past, present and future, through the prism of God's unrelenting love.",

          "description": "You Have Been Called and You Have Answered. Welcome. The Four Fundamental Aspects of Love is based on the teachings of Mary Magdalene, as received by Judy Satori. It is a journey of exploration to the place of inner earth called Amenti - a process of initiation to receive higher knowledge. There are seven gates to be passed through. At each one there is a challenge to demonstrate to the guardian of that gate your worthiness and readiness to receive this knowledge. With each successive passage you are blessed with higher energies in preparation for standing before the Seven Lords of Amenti. Hear from them what it means for you to have won the right to be and to become. After returning from Amenti, the four fundamental aspects of love - Loving Wisdom, Loving Kindness, Loving Strength and Loving Being-ness, and the symbol of four spirals are introduced. The most important thing about the four fundamental aspects of love is the connection with the truth of the soul through practicing Loving Wisdom. Loving Wisdom - tuning in and hearing the voice of the heart - is the wellspring of loving creation. All else follows. Enter this imaginative story to stand in the light of the truth that you are. Recognize the beautiful soul that you are and always have been. Reconnect with your authentic self and BE the love that you are. Practice how to be joyful from a place of peace. Gently guide your practice of Loving Wisdom using the seventy-eight angel-inspired compositions complete with \"I am\" statements. Cheryl Jackson has been a student of metaphysical concepts for over thirty years. Much of the basis of her knowledge came from a local angel and ascended master communicator. She added the teachings of Judy Satori in 2015 and continues to study Judy's teachings. Cheryl was granted permission by Judy and Spirit to continue these teachings of Mary Magdalene. The Four Fundamental Aspects of Love is her first book.",

          "description": "Fandom has been celebrated both as a harmonious, tolerant space and as apolitical and detached from reality. Yet fandom is neither harmonious nor apolitical. Throughout the past century, fandom has been shaped by recurring controversies and sparked by the emergence of new circles, platforms and discourses. Since the earliest days of science-fiction fandom, fans have conceived of their communities as quasi-political bodies, and of themselves as public actors in discursive spaces. They are concerned with the organizational structures, norms, and borders of fandom as well as their own position within it all. This latter concern has moved to the forefront as fan practices and platforms have been coopted by the entertainment industry and by political actors, forcing fans to situate their fannish and political identities in relation to both sprawling transmedia franchises and right-wing groups exploiting fannish formations for political ends. Through case studies of Glee and The Hunger Games fandoms as well as events such as Gamergate, RaceFail '09 and the Hugo Awards controversies, this book explores the complexities of political fandom.",

There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it's haunting Harry Potter's dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror? It's not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Now Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability of the very government of the magical world and the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts. Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable sacrifice. This stunning illustrated edition brings together the talents of award-winning artists Jim Kay and Neil Packer in a visual feast, featuring iconic scenes and much loved characters -- Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and many more -- as the Order of the Phoenix keeps watch over Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts. Special features of this deluxe collector's edition include a generously oversized clothbound book in a slipcase with intricate gold foil stamping; high quality paper with gilt edges; two ribbon bookmarks; a special art print; and a bespoke packing carton -- an impressive gift for Harry Potter fans and book lovers of all ages.",

How much is your commute time really worth? How do you work out how likely you are to get Covid based on the official statistics? How do your viewing hours track against the most popular shows on Netflix? Whether you're interested in global problems like climate change, and understanding that the Australian wildfires destroyed an area twice the size of Portugal, or just grasping how few people have washed their hands between visiting the bathroom and touching your hands, this book will help math-lovers and math-haters alike translate the numbers that animate our world. Until very recently, most languages had no words for numbers greater than five - anything from six to infinity was known as 'lots'. While the numbers in our world have become increasingly complex, our brains are stuck in the past. Yet the ability to communicate and understand numbers has never mattered more. How can we more effectively translate numbers and stats - so fundamental to the next big idea - to make data come to life? Drawing on years of research into making ideas stick, Chip Heath and Karla Starr outline six critical principles that will give anyone the tools to communicate numbers with more transparency and meaning. Using concepts such as simplicity, concreteness and familiarity, they reveal what's compelling about a number and show how to transform it into its most engaging form.",

          "description": "The world of Harry Potter had grown deeply meaningful for those who came of age using Hogwarts's four houses as shorthand for personality types and seeing the shadow of Voldemort in real-world acts of oppression. For them, Harry Potter is not just a series of books and movies and merchandise but a way of sortingright from wrong that they can remember and draw on for the rest of their lives. For countless readers, Platform 93/4 has served as a gateway into a world in which conflicts between good and evil unfold not in the distant past but the here and now. But it's also doubled as an invitation to explore a long tradition of fantasy literature, fable, folklore and myth, a tradition in which Harry and his friends are now ensconced. Like Oz and Narnia before it, it's a world destined not only to enchant one generation of readers but to be passed down from one to the next. There's magic in that that nothing can undo.",

          "description": "In 2011, the cinematic release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 marked the end of the narrative journey of the orphan boy wizard Harry Potter. Since the end of the phenomenally successful books and films, however, the Harry Potter franchise has continued to expand, generating new texts such as the Fantastic Beasts film series and the stageplay sequel Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ‚Äì alongside other opportunities to revisit the magical universe such as the 'Wizarding World of Harry Potter' theme parks and the Warner Bros. Studio Tour: The Making of Harry Potter in Watford, UK. This book traces the development of the Potter franchise in the crucial period following the books and films to explore how Harry Potter became the 'Wizarding World', a transmedia world-building phenomenon that expanded the franchise into new times, places and media while reinforcing the value of the Harry Potter texts at its core. Using five different case studies across five different media forms, this truly interdisciplinary study mingles textual analysis and empirical research to offer compelling insight into not only the business strategies of one of the world's best-loved and best-known franchises, but the wider contemporary media environment as well.",

But alchemy is not about money or eternal life, it is much more about the transformations of desire, of power and of people--through love. Harry's equally remarkable and ordinary power to love leads to his desire to find but not use the Philosopher's Stone at the start of the series and his wish to end the destructive power of the Elder Wand at the end. This collection of essays on alchemical symbolism and transformations in Rowling's series demonstrates how Harry's work with magical objects, people, and creatures transfigure desire, power, and identity. As Harry's leaden existence on Privet Drive is transformed in the company of his friends and teachers, the Harry Potter novels have transformed millions of readers, inspiring us to find the gold in our ordinary lives.",

It's hard to believe, but 20 years have passed since a baby-faced Daniel Radcliffe took the screen test that would lead to him becoming Harry Potter for an entire generation of movie-goers. And now it's time to introduce a new generation to the magic that is the Harry Potter films. Join Cecilia Tan, a writer, editor, and devoted Harry Potter fan, as she takes you back to Hogwarts, through a fan-centric guided tour of all eight movies in THE BINGE WATCHER'S GUIDE TO THE HARRY POTTER FILMS where you can re-live all the excitement and wonder of seeing Harry hop on his broom for the very first time. Tan will guide you through loving, fun--yet occasionally snarky--recaps of each film, as well slather on many behind-the-scenes facts and stories about how the films were made. Casting decisions, near misses, movie artistry: she‚Äôll cover it all, and more, as well as critical analysis of the films' significance in pop culture, filmmaking, and history. Not only that, since this is a Binge Watcher's Guide, Tan shares actual tips for binge watching, including recipes and suggestions for hosting your own Harry Potter themed binge-watching party.",

          "description": "For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, \"He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.\" Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may be a traitor in their midst. This edition has been beautifully designed with illustrations by Jim Kay and is packed with breathtaking scenes and unforgettable characters.",

We can be Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Ham, Black Panther or Rocket Raccoon through our everyday choices. We can't fly, fix hyper drives or hear human heartbeats a mile away, but we can think about what Matt Murdock would do in a conflict, how Superman would respond to natural disasters and how Captain America would handle humanitarian crises. This book analyzes the impact of dozens of comics by examining the noble personalities, traits and actions of the main characters. Chapters detail how superheroes, comic books and other pop culture phenomena offer more than pure entertainment, and how we can better model ourselves after our favorite heroes. Through our good deeds, quick thinking and positive choices, we can become more like superheroes than we ever imagined.",

Is it possible the Metropolis Marvel could be losing a step? The Man of Steel's struggles in taking down the creatures from the Breach would suggest as much! If he's going to continue to protect the people of Earth, he'll have to adapt--especially with threats like Mongul out there waiting to launch their biggest attacks on the Earth yet. After a war-torn battleship escapes Warworld and makes the perilous journey to Earth, Superman searches for answers about the identities of its mysterious refugees and their apparent link to the planet Krypton. Could there be other Kryptonians in the universe? Meanwhile, Atlantean scientists study the wreckage of the Warworld vessel...and make a shocking discovery that could change the balance of power on Earth.

The subsequent decades have brought even more adaptations of the Man of Steel, his friends, family, and enemies in film, television, comic strip, radio, novels, video games, and even a musical. The rapid adaptation of the Man of Steel occurred before the character and storyworld were fully developed on the comic book page, allowing the adaptations an unprecedented level of freedom and adaptability. The essays in this collection provide specific insight into the practice of adapting Superman from comic books to other media and cultural contexts through a variety of methods, including social, economic, and political contexts. Authors touch on subjects such as the different international receptions to the characters, the evolution of both Clark Kent's character and Superman's powers, the importance of the radio, how the adaptations interact with issues such as racism and Cold War paranoia, and the role of fan fiction in the franchise. By applying a wide range of critical approaches to adaption and Superman, this collection offers new insights into our popular entertainment and our cultural history.",

          "description": "Superman is the original superhero, an American icon, and arguably the most famous character in the world--and he's Jewish! Introduced in June 1938, the Man of Steel was created by two Jewish teens, Jerry Siegel, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, and Joe Shuster, an immigrant. They based their hero's origin story on Moses, his strength on Samson, his mission on the golem, and his nebbish secret identity on themselves. They made him a refugee fleeing catastrophe on the eve of World War II and sent him to tear Nazi tanks apart nearly two years before the US joined the war. In the following decades, Superman's mostly Jewish writers, artists, and editors continued to borrow Jewish motifs for their stories, basing Krypton's past on Genesis and Exodus, its society on Jewish culture, the trial of Lex Luthor on Adolf Eichmann's, and a future holiday celebrating Superman on Passover. A fascinating journey through comic book lore, American history, and Jewish tradition, this book examines the entirety of Superman's career from 1938 to date, and is sure to give readers a newfound appreciation for the Mensch of Steel!",

          "description": "Superman is the original superhero, an American icon, and arguably the most famous character in the world--and he's Jewish! Introduced in June 1938, the Man of Steel was created by two Jewish teens, Jerry Siegel, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, and Joe Shuster, an immigrant. They based their hero's origin story on Moses, his strength on Samson, his mission on the golem, and his nebbish secret identity on themselves. They made him a refugee fleeing catastrophe on the eve of World War II and sent him to tear Nazi tanks apart nearly two years before the US joined the war. In the following decades, Superman's mostly Jewish writers, artists, and editors continued to borrow Jewish motifs for their stories, basing Krypton's past on Genesis and Exodus, its society on Jewish culture, the trial of Lex Luthor on Adolf Eichmann's, and a future holiday celebrating Superman on Passover. A fascinating journey through comic book lore, American history, and Jewish tradition, this book examines the entirety of Superman's career from 1938 to date, and is sure to give readers a newfound appreciation for the Mensch of Steel!",

And then there is Cyborg Superman, a warped reflection of the real deal, with a mission as opposite to Superman‚Äôs as any could be. But no matter how out there the situation gets, it always comes back to the one man and the planet he loves and has sworn to protect-and the people he inspires, young and old.",

Superman and Jesus have many similarities: They both come from other worlds, raised by humans, sent out to discover themselves, and provide hope to the world. Is this because of who they are....or how their stories are told? Similar to Joseph (Hero of a Thousand Faces/Power of Myth) Campbell's work in Mythology, this book looks into Jesus and Superman's journeys being linked by a thread of storytelling that spans time and many other hero characters; including Batman, Spider-Man, and Luke Skywalker. If you've wondered why Jesus' story is told the way it is in the four gospels, perhaps looking at the story of Superman can shed some light.",

Around the world, everyone knows that when they see a red and blue streak in the sky, it‚Äôs not a bird...it‚Äôs not a plane...it‚Äôs Superman. To start things off, Academy Award-winning writer of DC Future State: The Next Batman John Ridley joins artist Clayton Henry (Batman/Superman) to tell a story of Clark Kent as he confronts a villain who still haunts him, in a story that shows what Superman can mean to a whole country. Then, Brandon Easton (DC Future State‚Äôs ‚ÄúMister Miracle‚Äù) and Steve Lieber (Superman‚Äôs Pal Jimmy Olsen) take readers to the streets of Metropolis to show how one hero can mean so much to an individual in pain. Plus, writer/artist Wes Craig (Deadly Class) tells a tale of Superman‚Äôs early days and the man who inspired him to become the hero he is today! And Marguerite Bennett (DC Future State: Kara Zor-El, Superwoman) and artist Jill Thompson give us a tale of teenage Clark Kent, while Dan Watters and Dani, the team behind Coffin Bound, bring us an outlandish fable about what happens when all colors are stolen!",

But what happens when that‚Äôs taken off the board, as a scientific experiment turns all the kryptonite on Earth to iron?

When all Kryptonite has been destroyed, the Man of Steel is anything but invulnerable as his powers slowly begin to fade and a doppelg√§nger Superman arrives on the scene with strange powers of its own-and any contact between the two might result in the destruction of the planet! Collects Superman #233-238 and #240-242, all newly restored and recolored for this special edition.",

Top priority for this new Superman: to protect Metropolis. When a new version of Brainiac attacks, Jon takes drastic measures-which result in the Bottle City of Metropolis! But watch out, Jon, because Supergirl is on her way, and she is not happy with your decision. Meanwhile, in the new bottle city, a new hero has risen. Jake Jordan, the former Manhattan Guardian, came to the City of Tomorrow to start over. But he‚Äôs not the only one who wants a new beginning. An anarchist calling herself Honest Mary sees this time of trouble as an opportunity for rebirth-and she‚Äôll tear down the entire city to prove her point. Does Jake have what it takes to save his new home from disasters both inside and out of the bottle? Superman‚Äôs former pal Jimmy Olsen is going to make sure he does! Finally, the current Mister Miracle, Shilo Norman, is also in the bottle, and he‚Äôs looking for a way out! He‚Äôd better be careful, though, or he may end up someplace unexpected. It‚Äôs a story that continues in Superman: Worlds of War #1!",

          "description": "Superman may be faster than a speeding bullet, but even he can't outrun copyright law. Since the dawn of the pulp hero in the 1930s, publishers and authors have fought over the privilege of making money off of comics, and the authors and artists usually have lost. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the creators of Superman, got all of $130 for the rights to the hero. In Empire of the Superheroes, Mark Cotta Vaz argues that licensing and litigation do as much as any ink-stained creator to shape the mythology of comic characters. Vaz reveals just how precarious life was for the legends of the industry. Siegel and Shuster‚Äîand their heirs‚Äîspent seventy years battling lawyers to regain rights to Superman. Jack Kirby and Joe Simon were cheated out of their interest in Captain America, and Kirby's children brought a case against Marvel to the doorstep of the Supreme Court. To make matters worse, the infant comics medium was nearly strangled in its crib by censorship and moral condemnation. For the writers and illustrators now celebrated as visionaries, the \"golden age\" of comics felt more like hard times. The fantastical characters that now earn Hollywood billions have all-too-human roots. Empire of the Superheroes digs them up, detailing the creative martyrdom at the heart of a pop-culture powerhouse.",

          "description": "From Superman, created in 1938, to the transmedia DC and Marvel universes of today, superheroes have always been sexy. And their sexiness has always been controversial, inspiring censorship and moral panic. Yet aside from jokes and innuendo, accusations of moral depravity, and sporadic academic discourse, the topic of superhero sexuality is like superhero sexuality itself‚Äîseemingly obvious yet conspicuously absent. Supersex: Sexuality, Fantasy, and the Superhero is the first scholarly book specifically devoted to unpacking the superhero genre‚Äôs complicated relationship with sexuality. Exploring sexual themes and imagery within mainstream comic books, television shows, and films as well as independent and explicitly pornographic productions catering to various orientations and kinks, Supersex offers a fresh‚Äîand lascivious‚Äîperspective on the superhero genre‚Äôs historical and contemporary popularity. Across fourteen essays touching on Superman, Batman, the X-Men, and many others, Anna F. Peppard and her contributors present superhero sexuality as both dangerously exciting and excitingly dangerous, encapsulating the superhero genre‚Äôs worst impulses and its most productively rebellious ones. Supersex argues that sex is at the heart of our fascination with superheroes, even‚Äîand sometimes especially‚Äîwhen the capes and tights stay on.",

Clean water is as basic to life on planet Earth as hydrogen or oxygen. In her long-awaited book‚Äîher first to reckon with the condition of water on our planet‚ÄîErin Brockovich shows us what‚Äôs at stake. She writes powerfully of the fraudulent science disguising our national water crisis: Cancer clusters are not being reported. People in Detroit and the state of New Jersey don‚Äôt have clean water. The drinking water for more than six million Americans contains unsafe levels of industrial chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues. The saga of PG&E continues to this day. Yet communities and people around the country are fighting to make an impact, and Brockovich tells us their stories. In Poughkeepsie, New York, a water operator responded to his customers‚Äô concerns and changed his system to create some of the safest water in the country. Local moms in Hannibal, Missouri, became the first citizens in the nation to file an ordinance prohibiting the use of ammonia in their public drinking water. Like them, we can each protect our right to clean water by fighting for better enforcement of laws, new legislation, and stronger regulations.",

Clean water is as basic to life on planet Earth as hydrogen or oxygen. In her long-awaited book‚Äîher first to reckon with the condition of water on our planet‚ÄîErin Brockovich shows us what‚Äôs at stake. She writes powerfully of the fraudulent science disguising our national water crisis: Cancer clusters are not being reported. People in Detroit and the state of New Jersey don‚Äôt have clean water. The drinking water for more than six million Americans contains unsafe levels of industrial chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues. The saga of PG&E continues to this day. Yet communities and people around the country are fighting to make an impact, and Brockovich tells us their stories. In Poughkeepsie, New York, a water operator responded to his customers‚Äô concerns and changed his system to create some of the safest water in the country. Local moms in Hannibal, Missouri, became the first citizens in the nation to file an ordinance prohibiting the use of ammonia in their public drinking water.

These solutions are applied to problems in tribology for modeling contact and friction of bodies with surface microgeometry (rough or textured). The book provides exact mathematical formulations for cases of discrete contact based on classical approaches of contact mechanics, allowing readers to study the influence of different parameters of surface microgeometry on contact characteristics and friction force. The book will help solve problems in modeling contact and friction interaction in cases of discrete character of contact interaction, mutual influence of individual contact spots in contact interaction of elastic and viscoelastic solids, calculating sliding and rolling friction forces as a result of adhesive and viscoelastic mechanisms of dissipation, and more. Provides a raft of solutions to contact problems for elastic and viscoelastic materials in normal, sliding, and rolling contact Provides solutions and formulations that consider surface microgeometry, adhesion, fluid films, viscous hysteresis in bulk material or surface layers, and other common material effects Features applied methods based on classical contact mechanics approaches, allowing for analytic and half-analytic treatment of problems",

          "description": "An integrated approach to the economics of sovereign default Fiscal crises and sovereign default repeatedly threaten the stability and growth of economies around the world. Mark Aguiar and Manuel Amador provide a unified and tractable theoretical framework that elucidates the key economics behind sovereign debt markets, shedding light on the frictions and inefficiencies that prevent the smooth functioning of these markets, and proposing sensible approaches to sovereign debt management. The Economics of Sovereign Debt and Default looks at the core friction unique to sovereign debt‚Äîthe lack of strong legal enforcement‚Äîand goes on to examine additional frictions such as deadweight costs of default, vulnerability to runs, the incentive to ‚Äúdilute‚Äù existing creditors, and sovereign debt‚Äôs distortion of investment and growth. The book uses the tractable framework to isolate how each additional friction affects the equilibrium outcome, and illustrates its counterpart using state-of-the-art computational modeling. The novel approach presented here contrasts the outcome of a constrained efficient allocation‚Äîone chosen to maximize the joint surplus of creditors and government‚Äîwith the competitive equilibrium outcome. This allows for a clear analysis of the extent to which equilibrium prices efficiently guide the government‚Äôs debt and default decisions, and of what drives divergences with the efficient outcome. Providing an integrated approach to sovereign debt and default, this incisive and authoritative book is an ideal resource for researchers and graduate students interested in this important topic.",

Equally controversial, it reveals his fundamental preference for a republican state.Comparing the practice of the ancient Romans with that of his contemporaries provided Machiavelli with a consistent point of view in all his works. Machiavelli's close analysis of Livy's history of Rome led him to advance his most original and outspoken view of politics - the belief that a healthy body politic was characterized by social friction and conflict rather than by rigid stability. His discussion of conspiracies in Discourses on Livy is one of the most sophisticatedtreatments of archetypal political upheaval every written. In an age of increasing political absolutism, Machiavelli's theories became a dangerous ideology.",

The scholars explore the interactions between anthropology and design through a cross-disciplinary approach, and while their approaches vary in how they specifically consider design, they are all centered around the design-and-anthropology relationship. The chapters look at anthropology for design, in which anthropological methods and concepts are mobilized in the design process; anthropology of design, in which design is positioned as an object of ethnographic inquiry and critique; and design for anthropology, in which anthropologists borrow concepts and practices from design to enhance traditional ethnographic forms. Collectively, the chapters argue that bringing design and anthropology together can transform both fields in more than one way and that to tease out the implications of using design to reimagine ethnography‚Äîand of using ethnography to reimagine design‚Äîwe need to consider the historical specificity of their entanglements.",

Reading fictional and popular cultural texts against real global contexts, it develops an ‚Äòaesthetics of justice‚Äô that does not advocate cosmopolitan mobility at the expense of care and hospitality but rather interrogates their divorce in neoliberal contexts.",

The first part of the book discusses levels and evolution trends of tariff systems of China and the U.S. from 2000 to 2014 and makes a comparison between the two countries' tariff structures. The second part centers on the Sino‚ÄìU.S. trade friction in 2018, analyzing its development, overall impact on welfare, and relevant impact mechanisms. The author draws on the quantitative analysis method currently prevailing in the field of international trade, taking global value chains, intermediate goods, and variable markup into consideration. In contrast to the research conclusion applying standard trade theory, the result indicates that either unilateral imposition of additional tariffs or bilateral tariff friction will give rise to the deteriorated welfare level of both countries. The book will appeal to academics and policy makers interested in international trade, China‚ÄìU.S. relation and the trade friction.",

As the team grows horizontally in number and vertically in levels, team management gets complicated. Managing Large Teams is borne out of the author‚Äôs twenty-five plus years of experience of navigating multiple scenarios, transitioning from an individual contributor to becoming a first-time manager to later helming teams as a CXO that expanded across North America, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia. Brimming with the wisdom and experiences of Indian and global CXOs, and Stanford LEAD alumni, the book tackles subjects such as handling multicultural and multi-locational teams, building a strong trustworthy culture of skip-level engagements and the oft-discussed phenomenon of executive isolation at work. Get your hands on this reservoir of knowledge on leadership, organization development and management practices for the present and future generations of performers.",

          "description": "Document from the year 2020 in the subject Engineering - Automotive Engineering, grade: 2, , language: English, abstract: Global chassis controller (GCC) design for autonomous vehicles relies on the information of the environmental factors, weather conditions, vehicle dynamics, actuation bandwidth, among others. Typically, various sensors and actuators are employed to provide such information. Challenges such as cost of sensors, actuator complexity and constraints, fail-safe operations, control authority allocation, and adaptability to a wide range of driving scenarios such as acceleration/ deceleration at set speed, double lane change, and driving on a circular path among others persist for design of such GCC architectures. Specifically for longitudinal-vertical vehicle controllers tuned to achieve safety and comfort objectives, the performance is significantly affected by the precise knowledge of road conditions i.e., tire friction and road elevation in the presence of nonlinearities such as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, spring and damper nonlinearities. For the longitudinal vehicle motion, tire-road friction conditions, aerodynamic forces, engine friction, and rolling nonlinearities critically affect the design of safety controllers such as traction control or active cruise control. Similarly, for vertical vehicle motion control using active suspension, the random road roughness and road defects, spring and damper nonlinearities, hydraulic actuator nonlinearities, and multi-objective design criteria, make design of controller a challenging task. With that motivation, the use cost effective virtual sensors to detect such external inputs and subsequent output feedback control solutions for the longitudinal-vertical autonomous vehicle motion is proposed in this book. The focus lies on adaptability of designed controllers and estimators to road friction conditions such as road conditions such as asphalt, snow, ice and the road elevation based on various rough roads and road defects.",

          "description": "An integrated analysis of how financial frictions can be accounted for in macroeconomic models built to study monetary policy and macroprudential regulation. Since the global financial crisis, there has been a renewed effort to emphasize financial frictions in designing closed- and open-economy macroeconomic models for monetary and macroprudential policy analysis. Drawing on the extensive literature of the past decade as well as his own contributions, in this book Pierre-Richard Ag√©nor provides a unified set of theoretical and quantitative macroeconomic models with financial frictions to explore issues that have emerged in the wake of the crisis. These include the need to understand better how the financial system amplifies and propagates shocks originating elsewhere in the economy; how it can itself be a source of aggregate fluctuations; the extent to which central banks should account for financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy; whether national central banks and regulators should coordinate their policies to promote macroeconomic and financial stability; and how much countercyclical macroprudential policies should be coordinated at the international level to mitigate financial spillovers across countries. Ag√©nor focuses on upper middle-income countries, which differ from advanced economies in terms of both their structural features (which include a financial sector dominated by banks, weak supervisory capacity, and a high degree of vulnerability to external shocks) and their long-standing policy challenges (such as managing volatile capital flows). Some of the analytical insights and broad policy lessons that can be drawn from the book will be of relevance to advanced economies as well.",

The scholars explore the interactions between anthropology and design through a cross-disciplinary approach, and while their approaches vary in how they specifically consider design, they are all centered around the design-and-anthropology relationship. The chapters look at anthropology for design, in which anthropological methods and concepts are mobilized in the design process; anthropology of design, in which design is positioned as an object of ethnographic inquiry and critique; and design for anthropology, in which anthropologists borrow concepts and practices from design to enhance traditional ethnographic forms. Collectively, the chapters argue that bringing design and anthropology together can transform both fields in more than one way and that to tease out the implications of using design to reimagine ethnography-and of using ethnography to reimagine design-we need to consider the historical specificity of their entanglements.

This Special Issue of Metals includes technical and review papers on, but not limited to, different aspects of joining and welding, including welding technologies (i.e., fusion-based welding and solid-state welding), characterization, metallurgy and materials science, quality control, and design and numerical simulation. This Special Issue also includes the joining of different materials, including metal and non-metals (polymers and composites), including 17 peer-reviewed papers from several researchers all around the globe (China, Germany, Brazil, South Koria, Slovakia, USA, Taiwan, Canada, and India). As of this date (April 2020), the papers in this Special Issue have been cited 47 times by other researchers, which I think is an eminent number and shows the high quality of the published papers in this Issue. This Special Issue includes a large diversity of various subjects in the field of joining: laser welding, friction stir welding, diffusion bonding, multipass welding, rotary friction-welding, friction bit joining, adhesive bonding, weldbonding, simulation and experimentation, metal/FRP joints, welding simulation, plasma‚ÄìTIG coupled arc welding, liquation cracking, soldering, resin bonding, microstructural characteristics, brazing, and friction stir butt and scarf welding. I would like to sincerely thank all the researchers who contributed to this Special Issue for their high-quality research. I also would like to acknowledge Mr. Toliver Guo, Senior Assistant Editor at MDPI, who continuously and tirelessly contributed toward this Special Issue by assisting me with inviting the authors and the follow ups. I think this Special Issue will enhance our knowledge and understanding in the field of joining and assembly. I would like to dedicate this book to my wife, Mehrnoosh, for her continued support and encouragement.",

          "description": "How did Canadian border officers come to think of themselves as a \"police of the border\"? This book tells the story of the shift to law enforcement in Canadian border control. From the 1990s onward, it traces the transformation of a customs organization into a border-policing agency. Border Frictions investigates how considerable political efforts and state resources have made bordering a matter of security and trade facilitation best managed with surveillance technologies. Based on interviews with border officers, ethnographic work carried out in the vicinity of land border ports of entry and policy analysis, this book illuminates features seldom reviewed by critical border scholars. These include the fraught circulation of data, the role of unions in shaping the border policy agenda, the significance of professional socialization in the making of distinct generations of security workers and evidence of the masculinization of bordering. In a time when surveillance technologies track the mobilities of goods and people and push their control beyond and inside geopolitical borderlines, C√¥t√©-Boucher unpacks how we came to accept the idea that it is vital to deploy coercive bordering tactics at the land border. Written in a clear and engaging style, this book will appeal to students and scholars in criminology, sociology, social theory, politics, and geography and appeal to those interested in learning about the everyday reality of policing the border.",

What‚Äôs New? Lots! Much is new and unseen before. Here are the big four: 1. Every concept is given in student friendly language with various solved problems. The solution is provided with problem solving approach and discussion. 2. Checkpoint questions have been added to applicable sections of the text to allow students to pause and test their understanding of the concept explored within the current section. The answers to the Checkpoints are given in answer keys, at the end of the chapter, so that students can confirm their knowledge without jumping too quickly to the provided answer. 3. Special attention is given to constrained relations and block over block friction problems, so that student can easily solve them with fun. 4. To test the understanding level of students, multiple choice questions, conceptual questions, practice problems with previous years JEE Main and Advanced problems are provided at the end of the whole discussion. Number of dots indicates level of problem difficulty. Straightforward problems (basic level) are indicated by single dot (‚óè), intermediate problems (JEE mains level) are indicated by double dots (‚óè‚óè), whereas challenging problems (advanced level) are indicated by thee dots (‚óè‚óè‚óè). Answer keys with hints and solutions are provided at the end of the chapter.",

In particular, we explicitly introduce informality in the labor and goods markets within a small open economy embedding financial frictions, nominal and real rigidities, labor search and matching, and an explicit banking sector. We use the estimated version of the model to run welfare analysis under optimized monetary and macroprudential rules. Results show that although informality reduces the efficiency of macroprudential policies following a convex fashion, combining the latter with an inflation targeting objective could be beneficial.",

          "description": "A new understanding of freedom in the black diaspora grounded in the erotic In Frottage, Keguro Macharia weaves together histories and theories of blackness and sexuality to generate a fundamentally new understanding of both the black diaspora and queer studies. Macharia maintains that to reach this understanding, we must start from the black diaspora, which requires re-thinking not only the historical and theoretical utility of identity categories such as gay, lesbian, and bisexual, but also more foundational categories such as normative and non-normative, human and non-human. Simultaneously, Frottage questions the heteronormative tropes through which the black diaspora has been imagined. Between Frantz Fanon, Ren√© Maran, Jomo Kenyatta, and Claude McKay, Macharia moves through genres‚Äîpsychoanalysis, fiction, anthropology, poetry‚Äîas well as regional geohistories across Africa and Afro-diaspora to map the centrality of sex, gender, desire, and eroticism to black freedom struggles. In lyrical, meditative prose, Macharia invigorates frottage as both metaphor and method with which to rethink diaspora by reading, and reading against, discomfort, vulnerability, and pleasure.",

The good function of numerous electrical, electrochemical, mechanical, and biological systems or components depends on suitable friction, lubrication, and wear as well as tribological values. In this context, the study of friction, wear, and lubrication is of tremendous pragmatic importance. The reduction of friction and loss of materials in relative motion are important challenges to improveing energy efficiency. This book guides the rational design of material for technological application. Chapters cover topics such as the resistance of dry abrasive wear, the role of a brand-new additive in the minimization of friction and wear, the structural-energy model of elastic-plastic deformation, the influence of micro-abrasive wear modes, tribological characteristics of magneto-rheological fluids (MRFs) and magneto-rheological elastomers (MREs), and different treatment technologies to improve tribological properties, among others.",

Indeed, phenomena such as the frictional resistance or the occurrence of wear can be observable with plain eye, but to characterize them and in order to make a prediction, a more detailed understanding at smaller scales is often required. These can include individual roughness peaks or single molecule interactions. In this Research Topic, we have gathered a collection of articles representing the state of the art in tribology‚Äôs endeavor to bridge the gap between nano scale elementary research and the macroscopic behavior of contacting bodies. These articles showcase the breadth of questions related to the interaction of micro and macro scale and give examples of successful transfer of insights from one to the other. We are delighted to present this Research Topic to the reader with the hope that it will further inspire and stimulate research in the field.",

          "description": "Video game design is an important aspect of how games can impact players in terms of behavior, player experience, and learning. How a game is designed and not just what is in a game affects how users are influenced. This dissertation introduces productive frictional designs as a new category of designs that may be useful for researchers and designers searching for creative and empirically studied methods to affect players in their games. Productive friction is hypothesized to create points of friction in the gameplay but result in positive outcomes for the player (e.g. learning, increased game performance, improved player experience). The framework for productive friction draws on theories from various fields such as the learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and player-computer interaction. For example, research on productive failure and microboundaries provide a theoretical basis for expecting positive outcomes from introducing friction into a game. Two types of productive frictional designs are proposed and examined: obstructions on game actions and juicy design. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of productive friction in the form of obstructions and juice empirically. In order to do so, two primary research questions were pursued: 1. How do productive and unproductive design frictions in a casual word game influence players' behaviors and experiences? 2. What effects might productive and unproductive design frictions in a casual word game have on game outcomes? A mixed-methods approach was conducted to investigate the effects and mechanisms of obstructive and juicy designs in a custom designed word game called Brave New Word. One study gathered anonymous game log data from 200+ participants who downloaded and played the game. Another study consisted of one-on-one video conferencing sessions with 7 participants that included think-alouds and interviews. The studies found that productive frictions in the form of obstructions have the potential to change player behavior by introducing microboundaries that encourage mindful interactions. Another general finding was that productive frictions in the form of juicy design have the potential to improve player experiences by creating engaging feedback but do not seem to impact player performances in games. These findings indicated that certain design frictions can be included in games to benefit players. Current user experience and player experience literature mostly align with these findings and support the conclusions made in this document.",

          "title": "THERMOMECHANICAL MECHANISMS THAT CAUSE ADHESION OF ALUMINUM HIGH PRESSURE DIE CASTINGS TO THE DIE",
          "publishedDate": "2021",
          "description": "Abstract : In high pressure die casting (HPDC) of aluminum, cast material adhering to die is a significant defect. Adhesion occurs in two primary ways. The casting may stick preventing its removal from the die. Aluminum can also adhere to the die and buildup in local areas on the die surface with additional casting cycles. This second form of adhesion is called soldering. Lubricant is the best technology to control all forms of adhesion, but it comes at the cost of casting porosity, blisters, reduced die life, and increased die casting machine wear. New strategies to prevent adhesion are desired to eliminate the downsides of spray lubricants. Thermodynamically, there is a drive to form intermetallic phases between the aluminum casting and steel die. The kinetically controlled formation of these phases has been understood as the primary mechanism which causes sticking and soldering. Assuming this mechanism, adhesion should be eliminated by coating the die surface with a non-reactive material, but laboratory and industrial experiments show that this approach is partially effective. Also, kinetics based predictions cannot identify the areas where adhesion is most severe. Additional mechanisms are needed to further predict and reduce these defects. Friction is such a mechanism, and it has been overlooked as a significant cause of sticking and soldering in HPDC. Sticking results from the thermal contraction of the casting onto the die. This creates a friction force that resists ejection and may be larger than the ejection force capability of the die casting machine. Soldering is a special case where the local shear stress due to friction exceeds the local shear strength of the casting. This typically happens at high temperatures and can be predicted by the ratio of the local ejection shear stress and temperature dependent shear strength. Four aspects of HPDC adhesion were investigated to support this friction mechanism. First, the accepted theory of a kinetically controlled approach to the thermodynamic equilibrium does not adequately predict sticking and soldering. Next, the decrease in sticking force with increasing draft angle is predicted by a friction model. Third, soldering is shown to occur when the shear stress at ejection exceeds the strength of the casting via hot ejection test and computer models of industrial castings. Finally, the friction approach is applied to a range of casting conditions and alloys with discussion of optimization opportunities.",

          "description": "Autonomous vehicles have the capability to revolutionize human mobility and vehicle safety. To prove safe, they must be capable of navigating their environment as well as or better than the best human drivers. The best human drivers can leverage the limits of a vehicle's capabilities to avoid collisions and stabilize the vehicle while sliding on pavement, ice, and snow. Automated vehicles should similarly be capable of navigating safety-critical scenarios when friction is limited, and one large advantage they hold over human drivers is the amount of data they can generate. With self-driving vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area collecting almost two human lifetimes worth of data just during 2020, this abundance of data holds the key to improving vehicle safety. This dissertation examines how data generated by self-driving vehicles can be used to learn control policies and models to improve vehicle control near the limits of handling. As data collection and vehicle operation near the limits can be expensive, this work uses skilled humans as an inspiration for learning policies because of their incredible data efficiency. This ability is clearly demonstrated in racing where skilled human drivers act to improve their performance after each lap by shifting their braking point to maximize corner entry speed and minimize lap time. Starting from a benchmark feedforward and feedback control architecture already comparable to skilled human drivers, this work directly learns feedforward policies to improve vehicle performance over time. By using an approximate physics-based model of the vehicle, recorded lap data, and the gradient of lap time, this approach improves lap time by almost seven tenths of a second on a nineteen second lap over an initial optimization-based approach for racing. Additionally, this approach generalizes to low-friction driving. While model-based policy search shows improvement over a solely optimization-based approach, model-based policy search is ultimately limited by the vehicle model used. Physics-based models are useful for interpretability and understanding, but fail to make use of the abundance of data self-driving vehicles generate and often do not capture high-order or complex-to-model effects. Additionally, to operate at a vehicle's true limits, precise identification of the vehicle's road-tire friction coefficient is required which is a very difficult task. To overcome the drawbacks of physics-based models, this thesis next examines the ability of neural networks to use vehicle data to learn vehicle dynamics models. These models are capable of not only modeling higher-order and complex effects, but also vehicle motion on high- and low-friction surfaces. Furthermore, these models do so while retaining comparable control performance near the limits to a benchmark physics-based feedforward and feedback control architecture. Though this control approach shows promise in operating near the limits, feedforward and feedback control is ultimately limited in its ability to trade of small errors in the short term to prevent larger errors in the future. Additionally, actuator and road boundary constraints play an increasingly important role in safety as the vehicle nears the limits. To deal with these limitations, this work presents neural network model predictive control for automated driving near the limits of friction. Neural network model predictive control not only leverages the neural network model's ability to predict dynamics on high- and low-friction test tracks, but also retains comparable or better performance to MPC using a well-tuned physics model optimized to the corresponding high- or low-friction test track. While neural network MPC shows improved performance over physics-based MPC when operating near the limits, MPC leverages its dynamics model with complete certainty. These effects can lead to MPC overleveraging its dynamics model, which in the presence of model mismatch can lead to poor controller performance. Additionally, when using neural network models in MPC, the network predicts vehicle motion with complete certainty regardless of the presence or absence of training data in the corresponding modeled region. To mitigate this issue, this work presents an approach which leverages a neural network model to learn the uncertainty in the underlying dynamics model used in MPC. By learning the uncertainty in MPC's dynamics model, the vehicle can take actions to avoid highly uncertain regions of operation while still attempting to optimize the original MPC cost function. The insights from this work can be used to design automated vehicles capable of leveraging vehicle data to more effectively operate near the limits of handling.",

          "description": "The contemporary design of hip implants for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) comes with modular components to provide flexibility for the surgeons during the operation. This modularity increases the number of material interfaces, each of can become a source of failure. Fretting-corrosion at the metallic components of the femoral head- stem neck (head-neck) interface can lead to THA failure due to adverse local tissue reaction to the emitted ions and debris from the interface. Literature review suggests loads on the interface, the geometry of the interface, and corrosivity of the ambient as the main effective parameters on fretting-corrosion of an interface. Loads acting on the head-neck interface of THA comprise body forces and frictional moments caused by sliding of the femoral head inside the pelvic cup. Body forces of daily activities have been well studied and are available in the literature. However, frictional moments of these activities, especially for metal on metal head-cup bearing, is poorly studied and is currently not available. Given the importance of load components on fretting-corrosion, the frictional moment of daily activities needs to be provided as an effective parameter of the study on fretting-corrosion. -- An analytical method is developed to provide the currently not available frictional moments for metal-on-metal bearing couples for different patient weights and wide range daily activities. For the nine investigated activities, the maximum magnitude of the frictional moment ranged from 2.6 to 7.1 Nm. The maximum magnitude of the torque acting on the head-neck interface ranged from 2.3 to 5.7 Nm. These induced torques on the head-neck interface were close or even higher than the pure torques previously reported for depassivation of the head-neck interface. Interruption of this oxide layer by fretting initiates corrosion of active metal underneath. Forces and frictional moments of level gait walking found to be in a range inclusive of most of the other daily activity and considering its high daily frequency, it was selected as the loading scenario of this study. -- A Finite Element Analysis, which was developed by another PhD student in the research group, was implemented to investigate mechanical responses of the head-neck interface to the frictional moments and forces of walking activity. Loading scenarios were frictional moment only, forces only and simultaneous frictional moments and forces. In the walking forces only loading scenario mechanical response of the head-neck interface had a considerable change as 8.43% initially separated surface nodes came into contact. The stress-field of the press-fitted area also changed temporarily. The frictional moments only did not cause considerable changes in the mechanical response of the interface (only 0.27% of the non-contacting surface nodes temporarily came into contact). The effect of frictional moments was considerable in superposition on forces in simultaneous frictional moments and forces case where the micro-motions and contact stresses changed compared to forces only case. The normal contact stresses and micro-motions obtained from this realistic load-controlled study were typically in the range of 0-275 MPa and 0-38 Œºm, respectively. -- In vitro investigation on fretting-corrosion of the head-neck interface was conducted on two different head-neck material combinations of Ti6Al4V-CoCr and CoCr-CoCr. To keep the stress field, induced micromotion and crevice geometry of the head-neck interface as of its service condition, a full-scale implant was studied under frictional moments and forces profile of walking activity. A range of frictional moment varying from 0Nm to 7.5Nm was combined by a range of forces from 900N to 1800N. It observed that Ti6Al4V-CoCr head-neck combination was more susceptible than CoCr-CoCr material combination. The non-loaded control value of Open Circuit Potential (OCP) of Ti6Al4V-CoCr was -0.311V against -0.116V of CoCr-CoCr material combination, and at the highest drop of OCP, their OCP reached to -0.615V and -0.506V, respectively. Frictional moments effects on fretting-corrosion damage were more considerable in the lower vertical forces (for example, walking force with a maximum magnitude of 900N). In the presence of higher vertical forces equal to 1800N, the variation of moments from zero to 7.5Nm had a smaller effect on the OCP and the fretting-corrosion response of the interface. The general outcome suggests that increase of the forces had a more intensifying effect on fretting-corrosion while frictional moments, is more effective on fretting-corrosion damage when is combined with lower contact forces. -- The outcome of this research suggests that frictional moments play a considerable role in both mechanical responses of the head-neck interface and fretting-corrosion of the head-neck interface. Considering the accumulative nature of fretting-corrosion damage in the interface, simplification of loading to forces only scenarios in FEA studies and in vitro studies need to at least come with a justified increase in the force magnitude.",
