                    <h1>The Best Books of 2020</h1>

                    <p>
                    It's not for the less "The Woman in the Window" by A.J. Finn, as we have here a woman who "does not know if she has seen or imagined what does she seen". <br></br>

Anna Fox lives in her house in New York, fearing to go out and she is spending the day chatting with strangers over the Internet, drinking wine (maybe more than necessary), watching old movies, remembering happy times ... and spying on neighbors.<br />

Then the Russells come to the neighborhood: a couple and their teenage son. The perfect family. Until the moment when during one night Anna sees something from her window that she should not have seen. She’s the whole world begins to crack and she’s own secrets come to light ...<br />

Tortuous, chilling, original, and moving, The Woman in the Window is a sophisticated thriller that has already attracted attention before being published. Translation rights were sold to 38 languages and Fox began working on its adaptation for the big screen.<br />

It debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list a week after it went on sale, something that did not happen with a first author novel unknown for twelve years, and stayed there for several weeks. The praises of the critic have poured, and as it is published in new countries this history repeats again and again.<br />

Well, and to enter another world we have "The Great Alone" by Kristin Hannah<br />

Alaska, 1974. Indomitable Unpredictable.<br />

And for a family in crisis, the ultimate test.<br />

Ernst Allbright returns from the Vietnam War turned into a different man. Unable to keep a job, he makes an impulsive decision: his whole family will start a new life in wild Alaska, the last frontier.<br />

At just 13 years old, his daughter Leni is eager to find her own place in this world, while her wife, Cora, would be willing to do anything for the man she loves, even if it means following him on his adventure into the unknown.<br />

In an inhospitable and remote corner of the country, the Allbrights will find out a small community of hardened men and women (even stronger) in which to carve a new future. There, Leni will have to mature very quickly, facing the challenge of wild and cruel nature, where his family hides and the stormy relationship of her parents. But then when the winter arrives and cold and darkness invade everything, mother and daughter will discover that, in a hostile environment, nobody can save you more than yourself.<br />

And to immerse in a real and tortuous life nothing better than "Educated" by Tara Westover.<br />

Born in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover has grown in harmony with a great nature and was subdued to the laws established by her father, a fundamentalist Mormon convinced that the end of the world is imminent. Neither Tara nor her brothers go to school or go to the doctor when they get sick. All of them are working with the father, and his mother is a healer and the only midwife in the area.<br />

Tara has a talent: the singing, and an obsession: the knowledge. She puts her feet in a classroom for the first time at her seventeen: she does not even know that there have been two World Wars, but she does not know also the exact date of her birth (she has no documents). Soon she would discover that education is the only way to escape from her home. Despite starting from scratch, she gathers the necessary strength to prepare herself for the entrance exam to the university, to cross the ocean, and to graduate in Cambridge, although for that she must break down the ties with her family.<br />

Westover has written an extraordinary story, her own story, a formidable epic, heartbreaking and inspiring, about the possibility of seeing life through third eyes, and of changing, a story which has become a resounding publishing success.<br />

But if you want to find out what can transform "An American Marriage" you have to read Tayari Jones's book.<br />

 she is happy in her new home, although she lives far away from her boyfriend Sam, who is completely in love and has a job in which she can fulfill her desire to help other people. However, you are about to meet someone who will make you rethink the direction of your life and remind you too much of a person who, although no longer there, is still present in Lou’s life every day and knows that he will be with her until the end. As in the two previous books, Lou makes us rejoice the reading with his crazy personality and his innocence and madness. He is one of those particular characters that we never get tired of and who bring everything together, since they give us many comical moments, but then we also soften our hearts with them on more than one occasion. I loved the fact that Will would continue to be so important to her and that, no matter what happens, she will never forget him in the fundamental moments of her life, since it has changed completely.
